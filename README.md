lowerdash
=========

My attempt at replicating the lodash.js library. 
This is more of an excuse for me to get familiar with js, testing in js, jasmine and karma.
Please feel free to review my code and offer suggestions/improvements. Pulls requests are always welcome.

Getting up and running
======================
Pre-requisites
--------------
 + nodejs 
 + npm (comes with node)
 + git
 
Setting up dev environment
--------------------------
 + clone the repo
 + navigate to that folder and run 'npm install'

Running unit tests
------------------
gulp test (recommended way)
karma start .\karma.conf.js (if you want to directly use karma)

TODO
----
- test null inputs
- compare results with lodash
